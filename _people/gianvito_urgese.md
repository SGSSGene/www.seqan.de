Gianvito Urgese is Assistant Professor at the Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning of
Politecnico di Torino.
He received his M.Sc. degree (summa cum laude) in Electrical Engineering at Politecnico di Torino. He designed, during
his M.Sc. thesis, an optimized HW accelerator for sequence alignment, implemented in VHDL on a systolic array
architecture. He was, in 2011, research trainee at Teseo S.p.A. involved in the design of a system for structural health
monitoring in composite materials. In 2008, he collaborated with the INRIM institute for a project concerning the
redefinition of Boltzmann constant.

His research interests focus on:
* Research and design of optimized task-specific bioinformatics algorithms.
* Development of tools for the study of non coding biological sequences (miRNA, siRNA, and lncRNA).
* Design of heterogeneous SW/HW architectures to accelerate bioinformatics algorithms, including parallel implementation
  on FPGA and GPU.
* Design of placement and routing algorithms for the mapping of Spiking Neural Networks in the SpiNNaker neuromorphic
  platform.
