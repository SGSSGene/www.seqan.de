SeqAn is an open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the
focus on biological data. Our library applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality,
extensibility, and integration with other libraries. SeqAn is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software
tools with a minimal loss of performance.

# Center for Integrative Bioinformatics

SeqAn is partner of the Center for Integrative Bioinformatics (CIBI) in the de.NBI network and offers services for
analysing sequencing data. Our services include the development and maintenance of the SeqAn library, its associated
applications and the build and test infrastructure of them, as well as, training and education by organising regular
developer and user meetings and providing online training materials.

Learn more about the [CIBI](https://www.denbi.de/network/center-for-integrative-bioinformatics-cibi) center and its
